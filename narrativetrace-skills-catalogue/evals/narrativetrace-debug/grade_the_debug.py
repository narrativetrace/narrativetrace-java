"""Grades a narrativetrace-debug trial: the transcript for ORDER, the scratch project for STATE.

Run by each case's graders/verify.sh from inside the scratch copy of
`fixtures/existing-service-checkout-currency`, with NARRATIVETRACE_TRANSCRIPT pointing at the
trial's transcript. The transcript parsing is the verify grader's own (`grade_the_verify.py`),
imported rather than copied: both read the same stream-json with the same rules (assistant-record
text only, numbered reads allowed, evidence from what the agent SAW).

The fixture's defect is a rounding in `RateTableConverter.convert` — it rounds to whole francs
before moving to cents — so 45.99 EUR at 0.93 is charged CHF 43.00, not 42.77. It is visible only as
a value: `#1.3 CurrencyConverter.convert(euroCents: 4599, currency: "CHF") -> 4300` with its child
`rateFor` returning the right 0.93. The structural trace is the same before and after the fix.

Every check prints one line, PASS or FAIL with its reason; the exit code is 1 when any gating check
failed.
